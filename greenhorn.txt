looking for pluck cms exploit, rce exploits require password

looking at login.php sources, it reads a variable called $ww to compare password
	this is defined in pass.php, and it's a sha512 hash
	this hash matches to iloveyou1
	we successfully log in
	using the exploit from exploit.db we get a reverse shell

there's mysql on 3306 but it doesn't seem accessible

there's user git, password auth works there, iloveyou1 doesn't pass

there's a user junior
	trying to log in gives an error, so password auth is disabled
		we need to find/upload keys?
	there's writable /usr/local/bin/gitea though impossible to overwrite because busy
	su - junior password: iloveyou1 worked
	we get user.txt

extract pdf file

extract image from pdf file

use depix with default search image to get password

remove spaces from password

we get root

bg terrible troll box :(
